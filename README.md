# dark-web-monitoring
Dark Web Monitoring System

Overview

This project is a Dark Web Monitoring System designed to scrape dark web forums, analyze threat intelligence, send alerts, and integrate with SIEM solutions. The system is containerized using Docker and includes Tor, MongoDB, and a Python-based scraper.

Features

Scrape Dark Web Forums using Tor and BeautifulSoup.

Analyze Threat Intelligence using keyword-based categorization.

Store Data in MongoDB for structured threat analysis.

Send Alerts via Email/Slack/Discord on high-risk findings.

Integrate with SIEM (Splunk/ELK) for real-time monitoring.

Dockerized Deployment for easy setup and execution.

Step-by-Step Execution Guide

1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dark-web-monitoring.git
cd dark-web-monitoring

2. Setup the Environment

Run the setup script to install dependencies and configure services:

chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh

This installs Tor, ProxyChains, MongoDB, and Python dependencies.

3. Start Services with Docker

docker-compose up --build -d

This will:

Start the Tor Proxy for anonymous access.

Launch MongoDB to store threat intelligence.

Run the scraper container to collect data.

4. Verify Running Services

Check if all required containers are running:

docker ps

Expected output example:

CONTAINER ID   IMAGE               STATUS          PORTS
abc123         dperson/torproxy    Up 10 seconds   9050->9050/tcp
xyz789         mongo:latest        Up 10 seconds   27017->27017/tcp
lmn456         darkweb_scraper     Up 10 seconds   

Ensure Tor, MongoDB, and Scraper are running.

5. Run Scripts Manually (Optional)

If needed, you can execute scripts manually:

python src/collect_data.py   # Scrapes dark web data
python src/process_data.py   # Analyzes and categorizes threats
python src/alert_system.py   # Sends alerts to SOC team
python src/integration.py    # Forwards threat data to SIEM

6. View Logs for Debugging

If you need to check logs for errors or data collection status:

docker logs darkweb_scraper

Example output:

[INFO] Successfully scraped data from dark web.
[WARNING] Potential exploit found: 'SQL Injection Dump'.

7. Stop Services

To stop all running services:

docker-compose down

Example Execution Output

Running collect_data.py

Command:

python src/collect_data.py

Example Output:

[INFO] Connecting to dark web...
[INFO] Successfully retrieved forum data.
[INFO] Data saved to MongoDB.

Running process_data.py

Command:

python src/process_data.py

Example Output:

[INFO] Analyzing collected data...
[WARNING] Potential threat detected: "Credential Leak Found"
[INFO] Data stored in MongoDB.

Running alert_system.py

Command:

python src/alert_system.py

Example Output:

[INFO] Sending alert to SOC team...
[INFO] Alert sent successfully to soc_team@example.com.

Running integration.py (SIEM Forwarding)

Command:

python src/integration.py

Example Output:

[INFO] Sending threat data to SIEM...
[INFO] Successfully forwarded to Splunk.

Troubleshooting

MongoDB connection error? Restart MongoDB:

sudo systemctl restart mongod

Scraper not running? Check logs:

docker logs darkweb_scraper

Issues with dependencies? Manually install:

pip install -r requirements.txt
